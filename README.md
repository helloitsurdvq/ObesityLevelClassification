# Obesity Level Classification
**Machine Learning and Data Mining Capstone Project - Group 09**
---
## Overview
Obesity is known as a multifaceted condition influenced by a variety of factors such as genetic condition, dietary habits, physical activity and socioeconomic status. The aim of this project is to use multiple factors to predict the likelihood of obesity of an individual, one of the significant contributor to cardiovascular disease risk. . By training a model that can accurately predict obesity risk, we hope to classify individual who are at high risk for developing obesity. Based on these insights, we can then develop interventions to prevent obesity and its related health issues in the near future.

## Dataset
Link to the dataset (we combined 2 datasets for our project): 
- [link1](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aravindpcoder/obesity-or-cvd-risk-classifyregressorcluster)
- [link2](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e2)

## Setup
Change the working directory to the project root, change the path of the project properly and then install required packages and libraries.
```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Another way to run our notebook, here is our kaggle link: 
[link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/longnguyenchi/ml-project-obesity-prediction-new?scriptVersionId=180279079). Please run the **version 15**.

- Here is the weights file of trained models: [Drive link](...), please put them into checkpoint folder for running the app.

- To run our application, please run the **app.py** file locally (using Gradio).
