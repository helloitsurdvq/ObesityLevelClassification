# Obesity Level Classification
**Machine Learning and Data Mining Capstone Project - Group 09**
---
## Overview
Obesity is known as a multifaceted condition influenced by a variety of factors such as genetic condition, dietary habits, physical activity and socioeconomic status. The aim of this project is to use multiple factors to predict the likelihood of obesity of an individual, one of the significant contributor to cardiovascular disease risk. . By training a model that can accurately predict obesity risk, we hope to classify individual who are at high risk for developing obesity. Based on these insights, we can then develop interventions to prevent obesity and its related health issues in the near future.
